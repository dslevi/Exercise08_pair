Get in loser, we're going shopping.
Ex-boyfriends are off-limits to friends. That’s just, like, the rules of feminism.
Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by Regina George.
We only carry sizes one, three and five. You could try Sears.
That’s why her hair is so big. It’s full of secrets.
It’s like I have ESPN or something. My breasts can always tell when it’s going to rain. Well… they can tell when it’s raining.
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners. We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina’s whole dirty history.
Say crack again.”
Crack.
 But you’re, like, really pretty… So you agree? You think you’re really pretty?
 I’m a mouse, duh.
 Can I get you guys anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me know! Oh, God love ya.
 I don’t hate you ‘cause your fat. You’re fat ‘cause I hate you!
 I wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school. I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy.
 One time, she punched me in the face. It was awesome.
 I want to lose three pounds.
 I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony. Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.
 ’Cause she’s a life ruiner. She ruins people’s lives.
 Regina George is not sweet! She’s a scum-sucking road whore, she ruined my life!
 If only you knew how mean she really is, you’d know that I’m not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right? Yeah, two years ago she told me hoops earrings were her thing, and I wasn’t allowed to wear them anymore. And then for Hanukkah my parents got this pair of really expensive white gold hoops and I had to pretend like I didn’t even like them. It was so sad.
 On Wednesdays we wear pink.
 Made out with a hot dog? Oh my God that was one time!
 Did you see nipple? It only counts if you saw a nipple!
 Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant, while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet? What’s so great about Caesar? Hmm? Brutus is just as cute as Caesar. Brutus is just as smart as Caesar. People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar. And when did it become okay for one person to be the boss of everybody, huh? Because that’s not what Rome is about. We should totally just stab Caesar!”
 You smell like a baby prostitute.
 I’m sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch. It’s not your fault you’re so gap-toothed.
 I guess it’s probably because I’ve got a big lesbian crush on you! Suck on that.
 Somebody wrote in that book that I’m lying about being a virgin because I use super jumbo tampons, but I can’t help it if I’ve got a heavy flow and a wide set vagina!
 Everyone in Africa can read Swedish.
 Oh my God, Danny DeVito! I love your work!
 I can’t go to Taco Bell. I’m on an all-carb diet. God, Karen, you are so stupid!
 If you’re from Africa, why are you white?
 There are two kinds of evil people in this world. Those who do evil stuff and those who see evil stuff being done and don’t try to stop it.
 I’m not a regular mom, I’m a cool mom.
My Nana takes her wig off when she is drunk.
Your Nana and I have that in common.
Gretchen, I’m sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea at Barnes & Nobles. And I’m sorry for telling everyone about it. And I’m sorry for repeating it now.
 She doesn’t even go here!
 I hear she does car commercials… in Japan.
 And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle, so that Man could fight the dinosaurs. And the homosexuals.
 Whatever, I’m getting cheese fries.
 I have this theory, that if you cut off all her hair she’d look like a British man.
 This is Susan from Planned Parenthood, I have her test results. If you could have her call me as soon as she can. It’s urgent. Thank you.

Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.

I'm sick from the disease eating away at me inside...

Hello Amanda. You don't know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose. The device you are wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaw. When the timer in the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I'll show you. There is only one key to open the device. It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around Amanda. Know that I'm not lying. Better hurry up. Live or die, make your choice.

Rise and shine, Adam. You're probably wondering where you are. I'll tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you've simply sat in the shadows watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? Now I see you as a strange mix of someone angry, yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch yourself die here today, Adam, or do something about it?

Hello, Mr. Hindle. Or as they called you around the hospital: Zepp. I want you to make a choice. There's a slow-acting poison coursing through your system, which only I have the antidote for. Will you murder a mother and her child to save yourself? Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.

Hello, Mark. If you are so sick then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? Let's put your so called "illness" to the test. Right now, there's a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is inside the safe - the combination to the safe is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in but watch your step... By the way, that's a flammable substance smeared on your body, so I would be careful with that candle if I were you... or all the people you've burned with your act just might have their revenge.

Hello, Paul. You are a perfectly healthy, sane and middle-class male yet last month you ran a straight razor across your wrist. Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die or did you just want some attention? Tonight, you'll show me. The irony is that if you want to die you just have to stay where you are, but if you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again. Find the path through the razor-wire to the door but hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock and then, this room becomes your tomb. How much blood will you shed to stay alive?

Dr. Gordon, this is your wake-up call. Everyday of your working life you have given people the news that they're gonna die soon. Now "you" will be the cause of death. Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. You have until six on the clock to do it. There's a man in the room with you. When there's that much poison in your blood, the only thing left to do - is shoot yourself. There are ways to win this, hidden all around you. Just remember, X marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by six, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon... and I'll leave you in this room to rot. Let the game begin.

Help! Someone help me! Is someone there? Hey! Oh shit, I'm probably dead.

I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a 15 hoo*** g*** b***!

I'm having a blast! This is the most fun I've had without lubricant!

I went to bed in my shit**** apartment and I woke up in an actual shit****.

My last girlfriend was a feminist, vegan punk who broke up with me because she thought I was too angry.

Face it Larry, we're both bullshiters. My camera, it doesn't know how to lie. It only shows you what's put right in front of it.

You want to know what I do? I'm paid to follow rich guys like you who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels to fu** their secretaries.

My name is Very Fu***ng Confused, what's your name?

No! Oh, my God! What are you doing? Lawrence, what are you doing? What are you... Oh, my God! Lawrence, don't! No! Lawrence, please! I'm begging you! Lawrence, it's not me who did this to you.

Goodnight little girl.

Dr. Gordon's time is up, now I gotta do what I gotta do and... I'm afraid it has to be you that tells him he's failed.

I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon!

He doesn't want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet!

F*** this shit! 

You know, we arrested a dentist last week who liked to play with kids a bit too much. He lived two blocks from here. The sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, doctor.
