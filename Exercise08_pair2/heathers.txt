EXT.   SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

     VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is
     jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit.
     Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.

     EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY

     VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an
     increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder.

     EXT.   PROMENADE--DAY

     VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.

     EXT.   THE SAWYER HOME--DAY

     Reveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto
     the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home.

     She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as
     the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative
     wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob.

     INY.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY

     VERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she
     launches into voice-over narration.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Heather told me she teaches people
               Real Life.

     Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the
     mirror then rambles off.

     INT.   HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY

     Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling
     high school hallway with a frozen smile.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.
               If you want to fuck with the eagles,
               you have to learn to fly.

     OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA

     With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the
     outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint
     approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that
     she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               I said so you teach people how to
               spread their wings and fly. She
               said Yes.

     THE DIARY PAGE

     VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words
     echoed by her voice-over.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               I said You're Beautiful.

     A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen
     to recklessly rocket across the written words.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
               God, come on Veronica!

     VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
     addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful,
     trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.

                             VERONICA
               What's your damage, Heather? You
               ruined my...

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me,
               blame Heather. She told me to haul
               your ass into the caf pronto. Back
               me up, Heather.

     From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily
     accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.
     She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.

                             VERONICA
               Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

     INSIDE THE CAFETERIA

     VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,
     strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.

     The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her
     toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and
     expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.

                             VERONICA
                       (submissively)
               Hello, Heather.

     Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER
     CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is
     consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks
     is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of
               Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge
               a hot and horny but realistically
               low-key note in Kurt's handwriting
               and we'll slip it into Martha
               Dumptruck's lunch tray.

                             VERONICA
               Shit, Heather. I don't have anything
               against Martha Dunnstock.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               You don't have anything for her
               either. Come on, it'll be Very. The
               note'll give her shower nozzle
               masturbation material for weeks.

                             VERONICA
               I'll think about it.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
                       (looking off)
               Don't think.

     POV ON CAFETERIA LINE

     Unattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
     guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.

     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

     VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the
     outstretched pen.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica
               needs something to write on.
               Heather, bend over.

     Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over. HEATHER
     CHANDLER violently laughs.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Heather Duke, back down.

     VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Dear Martha, you're so sweet..

     THE JOCKS' TABLE

     The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY, the serene black EARL
     FRAZIER and the massive RAM sit with other stereotypical
     Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

                             KURT
               It'd be so righteous to be in a
               Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler
               sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.

     KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists
     together.

                             RAM
               Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on
               my Johnson and just start spinning
               her like a fucking pinwheel.

     RAM makes a frantic spinning motion. EARL is bored.

                             EARL
               Shit. Right.

                             RAM
               Damn right right.

     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

     In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up
     along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.

     VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then,
     grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward
     VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as
     MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER
     passes the note to her frantic disciple.

     In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA
     saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the
     note onto MARTHA's tray.

     The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
     past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,
     bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand
     which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner
     reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.

                             PETER
               Come on people, let's give that
               leftover lunch money to people
               without lunches! Those tater tots
               you threw away today are a delicacy
               in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!

     HEATHERS' TABLE

     The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and
     HEATHER DUKE sitting themselves down first.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
                       (looking to the stand)
               God, aren't they fed yet? Do they
               even have Thanksgiving in Africa?

                             VERONICA
                       (low key sarcasm)
               Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater
               tots; it's a real party continent.

     HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Sawyer. Guess what today is?

                             VERONICA
               Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So
               what's the question?

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Yeah, so what's the question?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               God-damn Heather, you were with me
               in Study Hall when I thought of it.
               Such a pillowcase.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (hurt)
               I forgot.

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table
     as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye.

                             VERONICA
               Hey, this question wouldn't be that
               bizarro thing you were babbling
               about over the phone last......

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he
               gave me another topic that was
               political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

     VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly
     captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark
     in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a
     Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact.

     Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly
     overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.

                             BETTY
               Sorry Veronica.

                             VERONICA
               Betty Finn. Gosh.....

     VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.

                             VERONICA
               I'm really sorry I couldn't make it
               to your birthday party last month.

                             BETTY
               That's okay. Your Mom said you had
               a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip
               my own birthday party for a date.

     VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.

                             VERONICA
              Don't say that.

                             BETTY
              Oh Ronnie, you have to look at
              what I dug up the other day.

     BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY
     FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween
     costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.

     VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows
     VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.

                             VERONICA
               I was talking with someone!

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Color me impressed. I thought you
               grew out of Betty Finn.

     THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

     A coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the
     approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club
     kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out.

                             COURTNEY
               Oh great. Here comes Heather.

                             COURTNEY'S FRIEND
               Shit.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

     Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA
     finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again
     and brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it.

     THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

     HEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids
     with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh,
               let me snare a tater.

     COURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER
     CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
     VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth
     doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot
     and turning back around.

                             COURTNEY
               Thanks. I just got it last night at
               the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.

     HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her
     eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               That's pretty very. Now check this out. You
               win five million dollars from Publishers
               Clearing House, but on the same day Ed
               McMahon gives you the check, aliens
               land on earth and say they're going
               to blow up the world in two days.
               What would you do?

     A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks.

                             KEITH
               That's easy. I'd just slide that wad
               over to my father. He's like one of
               the top brokers in the state.

                             VERONICA
               Wake up. In two days, Earth's going
               up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.

                             KEITH
               Man, in two days, my dad could
               double my money. Triple it.

                             COURTNEY
               If I got that money, I'd give it
               all to the poor. Every cent.

                             VERONICA
               You're beautiful.

     THE FAMINE FUND STAND

     PETER reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills.
